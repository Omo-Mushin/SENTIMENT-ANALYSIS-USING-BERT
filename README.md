# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-USING-BERT

# Sentiment Analysis Using BERT

This repository demonstrates a sentiment analysis project leveraging BERT embeddings to classify text data. The project combines state-of-the-art NLP techniques with traditional machine learning pipelines to accurately capture the sentiment of textual content.

## Overview

The project utilizes BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to extract contextual embeddings from text. These embeddings are then fed into a classification model to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of each input. Key aspects include:

- **BERT Embeddings:** Utilizes pre-trained BERT models to generate high-quality, context-aware embeddings.
- **Classification Pipeline:** Implements a sentiment classifier using the generated embeddings.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes steps for cleaning and preparing text data for analysis.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluates model performance using standard metrics (accuracy, F1-score, etc.).

Project Background
This project is part of my portfolio, showcasing my expertise in natural language processing and machine learning. By integrating BERT into a sentiment analysis framework, I demonstrate how modern NLP techniques can be applied to derive actionable insights from text data. The approach can be adapted to various applications, from social media monitoring to customer feedback analysis.
